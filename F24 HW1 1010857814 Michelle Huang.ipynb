First, it prevents unnecessary data loss by eliminating irrelevant columns that contain a significant number of missing values before rows are dropped. This approach allows you to concentrate on the relevant columns, ensuring that only rows with missing values in important data are removed. Additionally, it leads to a more efficient and controlled data cleaning process, minimizing the risk of inadvertently discarding valuable information. This method also enhances clarity in the data cleaning steps, making the overall process more structured and comprehensible. By carefully sequencing these operations, you can retain more valid data for analysis while effectively cleaning your dataset."
