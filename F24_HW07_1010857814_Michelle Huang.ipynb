    "    1. This would have been easy to do following the instructions [here](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/example_formulas.html). A good alternative analagous presentation for logistic regression I just found seems to be this one from a guy named [Andrew](https://www.andrewvillazon.com/logistic-regression-python-statsmodels/). He walks you through the `logit` alternative to `OLS` given [here](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/api.html#discrete-and-count-models).\n",

    "### Evaluating the Need for the Interaction Term\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the fit of both models. If the interaction model yields a significantly different curve, it indicates that the interaction term accounts for additional variation in the probabilities of social connection. Statistically, a likelihood-ratio test can formally compare these models. However, from a visual perspective, if the interaction model generates distinct curves for different genders that diverge from those of the additive model, it suggests that the interaction is significant.\n",

    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The additive model considers each predictor independently, resulting in a more straightforward interpretation. In contrast, the interaction model allows predictors to influence one another‚Äôs effects, potentially providing a better fit if the combined impact of Age and Gender on social connection varies."

    "> _In `formula='HP ~ Q(\"Sp. Def\") * C(Generation)'` the `Q` stands for \"quote\" and is needed to access column names when they have a \"space\" in their name, while the `C` indicates a **categorical** use of what is actually an **integer** valued column. Despite technically being **continuous** numbers, **integer** often simply indicate categories which should not necessarily be treated as an incremental **continuous predictor variable**. Remember, a model such as $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ means for each unit increase in $x$ the outcome increases \"on average\" by $\\beta_1$; so, if $x$ takes on the values `1` through `6` as the `Generation` **predictor variable** here does, then this means the average value for \"Generation 1\" must be $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1$ while for \"Generation 2\" it must be $\\beta_0 + 2\\times \\beta_1$ (and so on up to \"Generation 6\" which must be $\\beta_0 + 6\\times \\beta_1$). This might be a very strange restriction to place on something that is really actually a **categorical predictor variable**. You can see in the given model fit below how this six-level **categorical predictor variable** is actually appropriately treated in the specification of the **linear form** using \"Generation 1\" for the \"baseline\" and **binary indicators** to model the \"contrast\" (\"offsets\") for the other \"Generations\"; and, how these are in turn used in the context of the **interaction** considered by the model specification._ \n",

    "The apparent contradiction between the low $R^2$ value (17.6%) and the presence of several significant coefficients (indicated by low p-values) in the model can be understood by considering how $R2$and p-values capture different aspects of the model's fit and explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding $R^2$: \n",
    "The  $R^2$ statistic quantifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable y that is accounted for by the model. In this instance, $R^2$ = 0.176 indicates that the model explains only 17.6% of the total variability in y. This suggests that a substantial amount of variation remains unexplained, implying that there may be other significant factors influencing y that are not included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding p-values and Coefficients: \n",
    "P-values help determine whether individual predictor variables (or their interactions) are statistically significantly different from zero, indicating an effect on y when controlling for all other predictors. The presence of many statistically significant coefficients (with p-values providing \"strong\" or \"very strong\" evidence against the null hypothesis) suggests that these predictors have measurable effects on y. Moreover, large coefficients (e.g., values exceeding 10) indicate that these effects are substantial in magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Both Can Coexist:\n",
    "A low $R^2$ indicates that while some variables in the model do affect y, the overall model fails to capture much of the total variability in y. This can occur for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictors included in the model may only account for certain aspects of y's variability, leaving a significant portion unexplained.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be considerable noise or random variability in y, making it challenging for any model to explain a large portion of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significant coefficients with low p-values suggest that specific predictors remain strongly associated with y even if the overall model fit is modest. In other words, each predictor can have a distinct and statistically significant effect without the combined model explaining a large percentage of the overall variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaway:\n",
    "While $R^2$ reflects the overall explanatory power of the model, p-values evaluate the evidence for the effects of individual predictors on the outcome. They are not contradictory but rather complementary: a model may not account for a large portion of the total variability in y, yet it can still identify predictors with statistically significant relationships to y. This is especially important in fields characterized by high inherent variability, where uncovering specific influencing factors (significant coefficients) remains valuable, even if the overall fit (as indicated by $R^2$ is low."

    "### Cell 1: Data Preparation and Spilt\n",
    "Initially, we load and preprocess the data. Specifically, we replace any missing values in the Type 2 column with the string \"None.\" We set a random seed for reproducibility and utilize `train_test_split` to divide the data into a 50-50 train-test split. This guarantees that half of the data is utilized for model fitting, while the remaining half is reserved for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell 2: Simple Linear Model Specification and Fitting (Model 3)\n",
    "We define a simple linear regression model (model_spec3) where HP serves as the outcome variable and Attack and Defense are the predictor variables. The model is trained on the training dataset (pokeaman_train), resulting in an \"in-sample\" R-squared value that quantifies the proportion of variation in HP explained by Attack and Defense within the training data. Additionally, we generate predictions (yhat_model3) for the HP values in the test dataset (pokeaman_test) and compute the \"out-of-sample\" R-squared by comparing the actual HP values to these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell 3: Printing In-Sample and Out-of-Sample R-squared for Model 3\n",
    "We display both the \"in-sample\" R-squared and \"out-of-sample\" R-squared for Model 3. The in-sample R-squared indicates the model's fit to the training data, whereas the out-of-sample R-squared assesses the model‚Äôs ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell 4: Complex Linear Model Specification and Fitting (Model 4)\n",
    "This cell presents a more intricate model (model4_linear_form) that incorporates multiple predictors and their interactions. The outcome variable continues to be HP, but this version includes interactions among predictors such as Attack, Defense, Speed, Legendary, Sp. Def, and Sp. Atk. This model enables the exploration of potential synergies and dependencies between predictor variables, which may enhance predictive performance on the training data. The model is fitted to the training dataset (pokeaman_train) and, similar to Model 3, provides an in-sample R-squared value for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell 5: Printing In-Sample and Out-of-Sample R-squared for Model 4\n",
    "After producing predictions (yhat_model4) for the HP values in the test dataset (pokeaman_test), we display both the \"in-sample\" and \"out-of-sample\" R-squared values for Model 4. This enables us to compare the performance of the more complex model (Model 4) with the simpler model (Model 3) and evaluate whether the added complexity results in improved generalization to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of Results\n",
    "#### In-Sample vs. Out-of-Sample R-squared:\n",
    "In-sample R-squared indicates how effectively the model fits the training data, with higher values signifying a better fit. However, a high in-sample R-squared does not ensure that the model will perform well on new data. On the other hand, out-of-sample R-squared serves as a measure of the model's generalizability. A high out-of-sample R-squared implies that the model generalizes well, whereas a low value, particularly when compared to the in-sample R-squared, suggests overfitting‚Äîindicating that the model captures noise or specific patterns from the training data that may not apply to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparing Model 3 and Model 4:\n",
    "If Model 4, the more complex model, exhibits a higher in-sample R-squared than Model 3 but a significantly lower out-of-sample R-squared, this indicates that the added complexity in Model 4 may result in overfitting. Conversely, if both the in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values for Model 4 are high, it suggests that the additional interactions and variables genuinely enhance the model‚Äôs predictive capability without sacrificing generalizability. On the other hand, if Model 3 maintains a similar out-of-sample R-squared to Model 4 while utilizing fewer variables and interactions, it may be favored for its simplicity and comparable generalizability."

    "> _The **overfitting** observed in the previous problem is a question of **model complexity** relative to the amount of information or evidence available in a given dataset (or we could just say \"the amount of data in a dataset\"). The **model fit** for  `model4` resulted in an **overfit model** because the specification of its **linear form** was overly complex (relative to the the amount of available data). Indeed, `model4` is rediculously complex as can be seen from `model4_fit.summary()`. This in turn allowed the **model fit** to \"detect\" idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. If a model is too **complex** then it will find and model \"patterns\" in a **training** dataset which are actually just accidental \"noise\" from the random sampling nature of the dataset. The simpler (or more parsimoneous) `model3` on the other hand was able to identify **predictive associations** in the **training** dataset which did **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. This is because `model3` only sought to understand simpler **predictive association** for which there was enough data in the **training** dataset to reliably detect and obviously identify. And these patterns were indeed sufficiently \"real\" in the sense that they were present and **generalized** into the **testing** dataset as well as the **training** dataset. So they could be \"found\" in the **training** and then used in (**generalized** to) the **testing** dataset._\n",
    "> \n",
    "> _This question therefore addresses the topic of the **evidence** a given dataset provides for the **predictive associations** detected by a **fitted model**. It should be increasingly clear at this point that evidence for a model can be addressed using **coefficent hypothesis testing** in the context of **multiple linear regression**, but that examinations of \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** metrics are what in fact are directly designed to address this question of **generalizability**. That said, this question introduces another consideration of **multicollinearity** as something that affects the **generalizability** of **model fits** in the **multiple linear regression** context. A good question that a ChatBot could help you understand is (a) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if two **predictor variables** are highly **correlated**?\" and (b) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if multiple **predictor variables** are highly **multicollinear**?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The four code cells below are not necessary for answering this question; however, they introduce two very practical helpful tools for the **multiple linear regression** context that are immediately relevant for this question. The first is the so-called **condition number** (of a \"design matrix\") which provides a very simple diagnostic which can serve as a measure the degree of **multicollinearity** that is present in a **model fit**. If this number is \"very large\" then there is a large degree of **multicollinearity** and suggests room for doubt regarding the **generalizability** of the **fitted model**. The second tool(s) are the `center` and `scale` functions. It is best practice to \"center and scale\" **continuous predictor variables** (but not **indicator variables**) in the **multiple linear regression** context as is done below. While \"centering and scaling\" does make interpreting the predictions on the original scale of the data slighly more complicated, it also must be done in order to get a \"true\" evaluation of the degree of **multicollinearity** present in a **model fit** using the **condition number** of the model (\"design matrix\"). The examples below show that the **condition number** reported by a **fitted model** are \"artificially inflacted\" if \"centering and scaling\" is not used. Specically, they show that the **condition number** of `model3_fit` is really `1.66` (as opposed to the \"very large\" `343` which is reported without \"centering and scaling\"); whereas, the **condition number** for `model4_fit` is \"very (VERY) large\" irrespective of \"centering and scaling\", showing that the overwheling presense of **multicollinearity** in `model4_fit` is in fact a very real thing.  Indeed, we have already seen that `model4_fit` is grossly **overfit** and does not remotely **generalize** beyond its **training** dataset. Without knowing this, however, the comically large **condition number** for `model4_fit` (after \"centering and scaling\") makes it abundantly clear that we should have great doubts about the likely **generalizability** of `model4_fit` (even without examining specific aspects of **multicollinearity** directly or examining \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** comparisions)._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _The \"specific aspects of **multicollinearity**\" reference above refer to understanding and attributing the detrmimental affects of specific **predictor variables** towards **multicollinearity**. This can be done using so-called **variance inflation factors**, but this is beyond the scope of STA130. We should be aware that the presence of excessive **multicollinearity** as indicated by a large **condition number** for a (\"centered and scaled\") **fitted model** raises grave concerns regarding the potential **generalizability** of the model._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The `np.corrcoef(model4_spec.exog)` examination of the **correlations** of a \"design matrix\" considered in ths problems prompt is analogous to the examination of the **correlations** present in a dataset that might considered when initially examining the **predictor variables** of a dataset, such as `pokeaman.iloc[:,4:12].corr()`. Indeed, such an examination is often the first step in examining the potential presence of **multicollinearity** among the **predictor variables** of a dataset. However, these are consideration of **pairwise correlation**, whereas **multicollinearity** generalizes this notion to the full collection of **predictor variables** together. A **condition number** for a \"centered and scale\" version of a **fit model** can therefore be viewed as serving the analogous purposes of a multivariate generalization of **pairwise correlation**._\n",

    "### The Design Matrix and Predictor Variables\n",
    "The model4_linear_form defines a complex linear regression model for HP, the outcome variable. It incorporates multiple predictors, including Attack, Defense, Speed, Sp. Def, Sp. Atk, and Legendary, along with their interactions. This broader set of predictors allows the model to not only assess the direct effects of each predictor on HP but also to account for interactions that multiply predictors together, capturing potential joint effects on the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "These interactions generate additional columns in the design matrix (model4_spec.exog), which contains the numerical values for each predictor and interaction term for every observation. The shape of model4_spec.exog‚Äîreferring to the number of rows and columns‚Äîreflects both the quantity of data points and the expanded array of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multicollinearity in the Design Matrix\n",
    "Multicollinearity arises when predictor variables are significantly correlated with one another, meaning that some predictors can be closely estimated based on others. In model4, the inclusion of numerous interactions and closely related predictors heightens the likelihood of this redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This redundancy in model4_spec.exog can be examined using the correlation matrix (np.corrcoef(model4_spec.exog)), which displays the pairwise correlations among the predictor variables. High correlation values in this matrix indicate the presence of multicollinearity, as the variables share overlapping information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity poses challenges because it renders the model sensitive to slight variations in the training data. When predictors are highly correlated, the model may accurately capture these relationships in the training set, but this fit may not translate well to new (test) data, ultimately diminishing out-of-sample accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Condition Number as a Measure of Multicollinearity\n",
    "The condition number of a design matrix serves as a measure of multicollinearity; a very high condition number suggests that multicollinearity is severe. It is standard practice to center and scale continuous predictors before fitting the model to ensure more accurate calculations. By centering and scaling the predictors, the condition number provides a clearer indication of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In model4_fit, the condition number remains excessively high, even after centering and scaling. This indicates that model4 faces significant multicollinearity issues, which are likely to hinder its ability to generalize effectively to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Multicollinearity Affects Generalizability\n",
    "When multicollinearity is high, model4 may overfit the training data by identifying complex yet spurious patterns that do not generalize well. For example, when predictors provide overlapping information, the model might \"learn\" patterns that are merely noise specific to the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, out-of-sample predictions (on the test data) are negatively impacted because the model is excessively tailored to the unique characteristics of the training data. This lack of generalizability is the reason why model4 performs poorly in out-of-sample evaluations."

    "> - _There are also often circumstances where **model interpretability** can be MORE IMPORTANT than raw **model performance** in \"out of sample\" **prediction**._\n",
    "> - _This is ESPECIALLY true if **predictive model performance** is relatively comparable between models of two different complexity levels. In such cases, the benefits of better **model interpretability** might provide a clear argument for the simpler (more parsimoneous) model, not to mention the additional potential benefit of more consistent improved **generalizability** over the the more complex model this might offer._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _This question drives home the point that a simpler (more parsimoneous) model always offers the potential benefit of more consistent **generalizability**, not to mention **interpretability**, over more complex models. We should *ONLY* use increasingly complex models that without questions outperfrm simler models. The code below illustrates this by further additionally raising the consideration that the random **train-test** approach used above is actually not the most natural one available for our dataset, which has different \"Generations\". In fact, if we were actually using this model to make **predictions**, we would increasingly acquire more data over time which we would use to make **precictions** about future data which we haven't yet seen, which is what the code demonstrates. And low and behold, this exposes **generalizability** concerns that we missed when we used the dataset in an idealized way and not actually how we would use such a dataset in practice in the real world (where data would arrive sequentially, and current data is used to predict future data). These **generalizability** concerns do affect both models, but the appear to be more problematic for `model7_fit` than `model6_fit`, which is certainly a result of the increased complexity of `model7_fit` which always opens up the possibility of model **overfitting**._\n",

    "#### Generalizability in Sequential Data: \n",
    "The models model7_fit and model6_fit are initially validated using a standard 50-50 train-test split, which is randomized. This approach often results in an overly optimistic evaluation of generalizability, as it assumes that the test data closely resembles the training data. However, in reality, data typically arrives sequentially (e.g., in later Pok√©mon generations), and using older data to predict future data provides a more realistic assessment of a model's generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequential Testing with Generational Splits:\n",
    "In this approach, models are trained on earlier Pok√©mon generations (e.g., Generation 1 or Generations 1-5) and tested on subsequent generations. This setup better reflects a real-world scenario where earlier data is used to forecast later data. By comparing the \"in-sample\" (training) $R^2$ with the \"out-of-sample\" (testing) $R^2$ in this context, we can evaluate how effectively each model generalizes to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity and Overfitting:\n",
    "model7_fit incorporates more interaction terms than model6_fit, resulting in greater complexity. This complexity can lead to overfitting, where the model identifies patterns unique to the training data but struggles to generalize to new, unseen data. Overfitting is often indicated by a significant drop in the \"out-of-sample\" $R^2$ values compared to the \"in-sample\" $R^2$, particularly when tested on future generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trade-Off Between Model Performance and Interpretability:*\n",
    "While model7_fit may initially show better performance in a random train-test split, its increased complexity makes it more difficult to interpret, especially with intricate interactions (such as four-way interactions). This complicates the understanding of which factors are truly significant in predicting HP. In contrast, model6_fit is simpler and therefore more interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalizability Concerns:*\n",
    "Although model7_fit initially exhibits high performance, it is susceptible to losing predictive power when applied to future generations due to overfitting. In contrast, model6_fit, being a simpler model, typically demonstrates more stable \"out-of-sample\" performance, indicating that simpler models often generalize better to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Interpretability:\n",
    "In instances where both models display comparable predictive performance, model6_fit would likely be the preferred choice. Its greater interpretability is advantageous, especially when the goal is to understand the relationships between variables rather than solely maximizing predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Modeling Strategy:\n",
    "This example illustrates that while complex models may achieve high \"in-sample\" accuracy, simpler and more interpretable models tend to be more reliable for real-world applications where new data is continuously encountered over time."
